Ken Snyder presented at the May 6th meeting on “Inheritance, Event Delegation and Named Function Expressions” <h3>Named Function Expressions</h3> <div id="_mcePaste">Kangax has a great writeup exploring function declarations and function expressions: <a href="http://yura.thinkweb2.com/named-function-expressions/" target="_blank">http://yura.thinkweb2.com/named-function-expressions/</a> . There are a few main differences:</div> <div> <ol> <li>Declarations are in the form `function name() {}`. Expressions are part of a code expression such as assignment: `var name = function name() {}`</li> <li>Declarations are parsed immediately so the functions can be run before declared; they are parsed even if in closures or conditional statements. Expressions are parsed when encountered.</li> <li>Declarations are useless unless named. Expression functions can be unnamed and will show up in stack traces as `?` or `anonymous`; when named, the name is only defined within the function itself (except incorrectly in IE).</li> </ol> </div> <h3>Prototypal Inheritance</h3> <div id="_mcePaste">Prototypal Inhertance is different than classical inheritance. Functions are king and inheritance is performed by setting the prototype property of a child class to a new instance of the parent class. See <a href="http://phrogz.net/js/classes/OOPinJS2.html " target="_blank">http://phrogz.net/js/classes/OOPinJS2.html</a> and <a href="http://pulpjs.org/examples/#cls" target="_blank">http://pulpjs.org/examples/#cls</a> .</div> <h3>Event Delegation</h3> <div id="_mcePaste">In the JavaScript Document Object Model, events bubble up to parent elements. See <a href="http://utahjs.kendsnyder.com/delegate/">http://utahjs.kendsnyder.com/delegate/</a> and the source code. The advantages include the following:</div> <div> <ol> <li>When child content is changed (e.g. via AJAX), the event handlers do not need to be re-attached</li> <li>CSS selector engines can be used to call different handlers for different child elements</li> <li>There are fewer event handlers</li> </ol> </div> One downside to watch for is many CSS selector engines including jQuery can be rather slow at identifying if the target element matches a given CSS selector. <a href="http://javascript.nwbox.com/NWMatcher/" target="_blank">NWMatcher</a> is a great selector engine that is incredibly fast because it works up from the target element instead of down from the source element or document.
