I thought I'd start a post for a place to discuss various game ideas. I love writing games (some times more than playing games). With NodeJS, multi-player games are easy to write. Pleas just add a comment to this post, and I'll try to collect the comments into this main post. These games would, obviously, be written entirely in JavaScript. NodeJS would be used as the server-side. So, here are some game categories and ideas: <strong>Massive Multi Player Online</strong>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">MMO</a> <ul> <li>Tank World - A large world with many teams. Each player is a single tank. Tanks can shoot other tanks, gain experience, pick up items, alter the landscape (move walls). Teams can create bases by altering the landscape. Large wars between teams should be encouraged. Player state is saved and restored between browser sessions. The game can span multiple days. When a player leaves the game, his tank disappears. When he re-enters the game, his tank appears (with his previous experience and items)</li> <li></li> </ul> <strong>Multi Player Battle Arena</strong>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena">MOBA</a> <ul> <li>DOTA/Newerth style - two teams of 4 to 8 players each battle on a common map. Each team starts with a base and fortifications. First team to destroy opposing teams base wins.</li> <li></li> </ul> <strong>Classic Games</strong> <ul> <li>Asteroids - multiple players teaming up to shoot all asteroids</li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">Tower Defense</a> - Players team up to destroy incoming waves of bad-guys. Build and upgrade towers. Gain money by destroying bad guys. This game *should* be able to be written to work even without sockets.</li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_%28arcade_game%29">Gauntlet</a> - RPG. Large world of bad guys. All human-players are a team against the bad guys.</li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sprint">Super Sprint</a> - Single screen car race. Everyone against everyone. Could allow for *lots* of cars (some ai controlled)</li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone">Battlezone</a> - tank vs tank</li> </ul> Edit: I created a group for Game Ideas.
