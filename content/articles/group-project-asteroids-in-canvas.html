The group is creating a clone of the classic Asteroids game in HTML5 Canvas. The aim is to learn JavaScript OOP and module patterns and Canvas. If you would like SVN access to the source, request a login at one of our monthly meetings. <a href="http://utahjs.kendsnyder.com/asteroids/roids1/asteroids/asteroids.html" target="_blank">Asteroids Demo</a>
