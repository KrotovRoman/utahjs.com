<a href="http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Missing-David-Sawyer-McFarland/dp/0596802447/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308760964&amp;sr=1-1">CSS: The Missing Manual</a> is fantastic for learning and reviewing CSS. Each example builds on the previous one, illustrating not only CSS concepts but how they are used together. The book explains each CSS property one by one so it is great as a reference manual. There are plenty of screenshots for those who learn best by visual example. It discusses browser compatibility issues and browser quirks in Internet Explorer as well as ways to avoid problems. I recommend this book to all web developers.
