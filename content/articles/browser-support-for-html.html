Niels Leenheer has created an interesting script to detect browser support for HTML5. <a href="http://www.html5test.com/" target="_blank">Try it here</a>. By HTML5, we mean the new HTML and JavaScript standards that are pushing the web to the next level. These are results from browsers on my Windows Vista machine: <a href="http://utahjs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/html5-scores1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156" title="html5-scores" src="http://utahjs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/html5-scores1.png" alt="" width="587" height="182" /></a> Feel free to leave your results in the comments.
