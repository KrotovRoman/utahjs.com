I highly recommend attending again -- Ryan is going to try to host this event monthly. I thought I'd attach my notes from the conference right in this post. <h5>Before the three scheduled speakers started</h5> Ryan talked about <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#">Google Insights</a> -- "With Google Insights for Search, you can compare search volume patterns across specific regions, categories, time frames and properties." He searched many JavaScript terms and showed how Utah is one of the current hot-spots for JavaScript activity. See some of these links: <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=javascript&cmpt=q&geo=US">Javascript in US</a> -- Shows Utah #1 <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=jquery&cmpt=q&geo=US">jQuery in US</a> -- Shows Utah #2 <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=javascript+prototype&cmpt=q&geo=US">Javascript Prototype in US</a> -- Shows Utah #1 <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=ajax&cmpt=q&geo=US">ajax</a> -- Shows Utah #3 <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=javascript%2C%20php%2C%20ruby%2Cc%23%2C&geo=US&cmpt=q">Javascript, php, ruby, c#</a> -- comparison -- Utah #1 <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=jquery&cmpt=q">jQuery worldwide</a> -- Shows an upward trend <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=nodejs&geo=US&cmpt=q">nodejs</a> -- Shows a serious upward trend (but not much data) <h5>Kris Zyp: NodeJS to the Browser: End-to-end JavaScript</h5> Kris built a presentation tool in JavaScript that he used for his presentation. It was really cool, and worth a look <a href="http://kzyp.dojotoolkit.org/presly/presly.html">here</a>. Press right arrow to advance to the next slide, and left arrow to go back 1 slide. Some of the terms that caught my interest: CommonJS, RequireJS, Transporter, Nodules, JSO NSchema, RQL. <h5>Zach Pendleton: Ruby on Rails 3</h5> Very good demo of how to use Ruby as a Rapid Prototyping Tool, or RAD. Zach built a functional blog in minutes. <h5>Ryan Florence: Organizing JavaScript</h5> Html5 now has a "data-" attribute tag that can be used. Ryan talked about using Depender or Packager to serve/combine JavaScript files together. Note: Visit the Utah Web Conference <a href="http://utwebconf.com/">website</a>
