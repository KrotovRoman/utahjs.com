Welcome to an introduction to the HTML5 canvas tag. The canvas tag is awesome. This presentation will start very simple with how to add a canvas tag to your webpage and how to draw on that canvas tag using JavaScript. We will rapidly advance to image animations, particle effects, vector based animations and using multiple canvas tags for advanced effects. The presentation can be downloaded, or viewed <a href="http://dan.utahjs.com/presentations/index.html">here</a>. You can download the entire presentation (which all runs off a local hard drive) <a href="http://dan.utahjs.com/presentations/canvasPresentation.zip">here</a>. Just unzip it and open the "index.html" file.
