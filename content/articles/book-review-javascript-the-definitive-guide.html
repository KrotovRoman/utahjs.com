<a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-David-Flanagan/dp/0596000480">JavaScript the Definitive Guide</a> is an excellent book for beginners and experts alike. It goes through every aspect of JavaScript one by one, even covering lesser known subjects such as applets and SVG. The code examples are simple and follow best practices. The code has been well thought out and illustrates the principles well. It is a great book to read right through and would be a great reference for coding in general. I highly recommend <em>JavaScript the Definitive Guide</em>.
