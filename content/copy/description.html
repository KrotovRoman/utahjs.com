<p>UtahJS is the website for the Utah JavaScript Users Group that meets to discuss and enjoy JavaScript!</p>
<p>JavaScript in the browser, on the server or just about anywhere else.</p>
<p>We love JavaScript but quite often talk about other topics such as CSS, HTML, cross browser coding, the internetâ€¦ pretty much, anything that we find interesting.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome. Please join us!</p>
